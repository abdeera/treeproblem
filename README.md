# treeproblem
This is a roleplaying game derived from 8 queens problem, made through my first year master degree in 2011. enjoy and don't forget to attribute the source in your work.

This game rolls starting from two dimentions, n=length of the board, m=number of trees to plant<=n.

As the player clicks on squares in same row/column/diagonal, he should take in count to not plant more than m trees in one line, hence the challenge figures, of attempting to maximise trees planted in the board, to outrun the opponent.

The game is in french, i will work on translation as soon time is available for me ! ;) thanks.

This software is accompanied with a report and research paper of 50 pages i wrote it during three months, including all heuristics and artificial intelligence approaches used to ultimize records. Contact me if you want it.
