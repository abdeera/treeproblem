# treeproblem
This is a roleplaying game derived from 8 queens problem, made through my first year master degree. enjoy and don't forget to attribute the source in your work.
This game rolls starting from two dimentions, n=length of the board, m=number of trees to plant<=n.
As the player clicks on square in same row/column/diagonal, he should take in count to not plant more than m trees in one line, hence the challenge figures, of attempting to maximise trees planted in the board, to outrun the opponent.

The game is in french, i will work on translation as soon time is available for me ! ;) thanks.
